# Face-Recognition-and-Object-Identifier
In this repository you will find a small Object Identifier library and a Face Recognition script

# How to setup
Install the libraries in the libraries.txt file and put the 2 .py files in the same directory

# What is it
This is my first computer vision software that recognize the faces of the people.
It uses the Object Identifier library to Recognize the people in one frame and then paste the regions where the people into a black image.
This process makes the AI "focus" only on the people in the frame so the face recognition will be more accurate and it won't be distracted by or misinterpret other objects as facial features.
